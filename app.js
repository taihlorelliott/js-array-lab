Exercise 2: Add strings to the array

1) Add 'pizza' and 'cheeseburger' to the `foods` array. 

Note: 'pizza' should be the first item in the array, followed by 'cheeseburger'.

Complete Exercise 2 in the space below:

Exercise 3: Insert at the beginning

1) Insert the string 'taco' at the beginning of the `foods` array.

//then i used splice to add and remove at the same time
//1 is pizza the 2nd item in the array and what i need to remove so i need to start there

Exercise 7: Using the `slice()` method

Exercise 8: Finding an index

1) Using the `indexOf()` method, find the index of the string 'tofu' in the

Exercise 9: Joining elements

1) Use the `join()` method to concatenate the strings in the `foods` array, 
   separated by ' -> '. 

2) Assign the result to a variable called `allFoods`. 

Note: The final result should log as:
'taco -> sushi -> cupcake -> tofu -> cheeseburger'

Exercise 10: Check for an element

Exercise 11: Odd numbers from an array

1) Choose a method to iterate through the `nums` array.

2) Push each odd number to a new array named `odds`.

Hint: Initialize the `odds` variable to an empty array before the iteration.

for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
//a for loop for declares it 
// let i = 0 starts it at the begining of the array, position 1 aka 0
//i < nums.length is a condition, if it is true the condition will keep going, if not it will stop this basically means the entire length of the array
// i++ means to keep looping plus one plus one

/*
Exercise 12: FizzBuzz with arrays

1) Choose a method to iterate through the `nums` array. 

2. As you loop, sort the numbers into new arrays based on the following rules:

   - Push any number evenly divisible by 3 to an array called `fizz`.
   - Push any number evenly divisible by 5 to an array called `buzz`.
   - Push any number that is evenly divisible by 3 and 5 to an array called
     `fizzbuzz`.

   Note: A single number may meet more than one of the above rules. If it does,
         it should be placed in multiple arrays. For example, the number `15`
         will appear in the `fizz`, `buzz`, and `fizzbuzz` arrays.

Complete Exercise 12 in the space below:
*/
const fizz = []
const buzz = []
const fizzbuzz = []
//these declare the new arrays and are currently empty

for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
   //starting the for loop at the begining, spaning the entire loop, counting up by one each time
   
   if(nums[i] % 3 === 0 && nums[i] % 5 === 0){
      fizzbuzz.push(nums[i])
      //if the intger in the array is divisible by 3 and 5 then display is fizzbuzz array
   } if(nums[i] % 3 === 0){
      fizz.push(nums[i])

   - Do not alter the original `numArrays` array.
